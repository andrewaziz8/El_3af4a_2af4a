## Description
This application integrates with **Google Maps API** to follow the driver's location and leverages a dataset of geographical locations using **Firebase** where the undesired obstacles exist. Moreover, the user contributes to this dataset through the sensor detection in their device that will capture these hurdles. These potholes and bumps are then used for real-time alerts with a user **feedback** feature to ensure reliability and adaptiveness to road changes. Moreover, our application employs **Foreground Services** to ensure the app continues running in the background even when other apps are in use. 

## Usage
The purpose of this application is to have safer and smoother drives on Egypt's bumpy roads, and it supports running in the background. Thus, the user can just open this application and leave it in the background while running Google Maps (or a similar app.) for their normal trip. There is a notification for optional feedback after each pothole or speed bump where the user can just confirm or deny the correctness of the alert, and this notification disappears after 5 seconds.
